## Objective

Demonstrate your proficiency in Splatoon by achieving consecutive victories with every weapon in the game. The challenge requires participants to restart and replay with previously conquered weapons upon any defeat.

### Rules:

- Weapons are assigned randomly for each match.

- Gear equipment is also chosen randomly and can only be used once.

- Players commence with 1 life and earn an additional life for every 10 victories achieved.

- A win must be secured with the randomly chosen weapon and gear before proceeding to the next one.

- In the event of a loss, participants must return to the beginning and replay with the weapons and gear they have already triumphed with.

- This process continues until a victory is obtained with every weapon in the game.

### Conditions:

- Skipping weapons or gear is not permitted; each must be used to achieve a victory.

- Progress can be tracked on our dedicated website, where players are encouraged to share their achievements with the community.
